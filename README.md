The password being cracked is the string variable "target" on line 5; you can change it's value to whatever you want. Apart from that the program is so straight forward that it is quite literally impossible to mess up, and if you still do somehow mess up, you don't deserve to use it.

I later plan to impliment other cracking methods such as a smarter way than just brute forcing and checking passwords from a .txt file (for example the RockYou list)
